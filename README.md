node-ostatus
============

An implementation of the [OStatus](http://ostatus.org) protocol stack for node.js

Copyright (C) 2010 Laurent Eschenauer <laurent@eschenauer.be>

** Ongoing development branch, unstable code, use at your own risk :-) **

Install
-------

If you are using npm (the node packet manager), installing is as easy as:
    npm install ostatus


Dependencies
------------

If you are using this from source, you can install the dependencies using npm from the root of the source folder:
    npm bundle

Or you can install all dependencies manually:
*  [node](http://nodejs.org/) v4+ is required, I'm developing against trunk.
*  [Mu](https://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu/tree/v2) the v2 branch
*  [Flow](https://github.com/willconant/flow-js)

Documentation
-------------

The API is documented in the [wiki](http://github.com/eschnou/node-ostatus/wiki). 

Support
-------

Please avoid sending an email directly to me. Instead, involve also other users by:

-  Filling an issue report in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/eschnou/node-ostatus/issues).
-  Asking your question on the [Ostatus](http://groups.google.com/group/ostatus-discuss) or [NodeJS](http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs) mailing list.
-  Ping me on twitter [@eschnou](http://twitter.com/eschnou) <== Ho irony :-) 

Client
------

In the bin/ folder, you'll find a few simple command line clients for ostatus. If you install with NPM, 
these will be linked and added to your path. 

### Status
Display the last status update of someone:
	status eschnou@identi.ca

Output:
    2011-03-06T14:25:08+00:00
    One day, I'll post these kind of updates from my own host. In the meanwhile, cheers !

### Profile
Display the profile of someone
	profile eschnou@identi.ca
	
Output:

Progress
--------

The following pieces of the protocol are implemented:

-  [webfinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/): 
   * Lookup a user account and return the user meta in a JSON format
   * Rendering of host/user meta based on a JSON input object
-  [pubsubhubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/): 
   * Subscribe/Unsubscribe to a topic on another hub
   * Verify a subscription request from an other hub
   * Distribute content to subscribers (with support for authenticated content distribution)
-  [hcard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard):
   * Lookup and parse a hcard into a JSON object
   * Render an hcard from a JSON object
-  [activitystreams](http://activitystrea.ms/):
   * Fetch an atom feed with activitystream content and return a JSON representation of the stream. The JSON object is a valid activitystream JSON object.
   * Render an atom feed from an array of activities in JSON
-  [salmon](http://www.salmon-protocol.org/)
   * Unpacking envelope and base64url encoding/decoding 

What is missing:

-  Magic envelope signature generation and verification.
-  Activitystream stuff is basic and maybe outdated.


My ToDo list
------------

-  Implement Salmon crypto stuff.
-  Complete the activitystream stuff.
-  Lot's of edge cases and interop issues to fix.
-  Get rid of o3-xml and use a Sax parser instead.
-  Get rid of the templates and generate the XML programaticaly.
-  Write more test cases.
